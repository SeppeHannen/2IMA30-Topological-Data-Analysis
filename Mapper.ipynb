    "# Mapper algorithm\n",
    "The mapper algorithm is a \"modular\" algorithm for creating a low-dimensional representation (usually a graph) of a large and/or high-dimensional (point cloud) dataset while preserving interesting topological characteristics. The results of the algorithm depend on three choices that we can make for it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A (combination of) *filter* function(s), mapping the dataset to a metric space (called the *parameter space*) based on some distance/similarity metric (e.g. height of points or angle relative to some center).\n",
    "2. An *open cover* of the parameter space, usually consisting of overlapping open intervals. The pre-images of the cover sets under the filter determine an open cover of the original point cloud.\n",
    "3. A *clustering algorithm* to divide the covering sets into clusters/\"connected components\". The graph will be constructed based on overlap of these clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default choice for the parameter space is $\\mathbb{R}$, which produces a graph as a result. However, Mapper can also be extended to $S^1$ (producing a graph with cycles) or $\\mathbb{R}^M$ (producing a simplicial complex of dimension $\\leq M$). For specific choices of filter and parameter space, cover, and clustering algorithm, we retrieve other well-known TDA algorithms for representing high-dimensional data, such as density clustering trees, disconnectivity graphs, and Reeb graphs; mapper is essentially a generalization of these techniques."

    "### Filters, covers & clusters\n",
    "The *filter* function essentially reduces data points to only their relevant characteristics (e.g. reducing a 3d point $(x,y,z)$ to only its height $y$). Given a set $X$ of $N$ points, the filter is a function $f: X \\to Z$ (usually the parameter space is $Z = \\mathbb{R}$, but it can also be $\\mathbb{R}^2$ or $S^1$) which assigns a value to each of the $N$ points. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then partition the *parameter space* $Z$ based on the range $I$ of $f$; this is typically done using a set $S$ of smaller, overlapping intervals, defined by a length $l$ and a percentage of overlap $p$. For example, if $I = [0,2]$, $l = 1$ and $p = 2/3$, then $S = \\{[0,1], [1/3, 4/3], [2/3, 5/3], [1, 2]\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we use this partitioning of $Z$ to derive a cover $\\mathcal{U}$ of $X$, defined by $\\mathcal{U} = \\bigcup_{I_j \\in S} f^{-1}(I_j)$. We also divide the *covering sets* $X_j = f^{-1}(I_j)$ further into clusters $X_{jk}$, which can be thought of as representing connected components. Ultimately, each cluster will be a vertex in our complex and represents the points within it. We draw an edge between clusters $X_{jk}$ and $X_{lm}$ if their intersection is non-empty, i.e. if there is a point which exists in both clusters (see also Figure 1 in the mapper paper). Note that a clustering algorithm usually assigns each point within an $X_j$ to *one* unique cluster; this means there will be no edges between clusters within the same covering set $X_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we divide these $X_j$ into clusters? That's using a user-defined *clustering algorithm*. Mapper does not place any requirements on this, so any (domain-specific) algorithm will work. This appears to be the part of the algorithm that Mapper is most sensitive to, so it's a good idea to test a couple different clustering algorithms, and in particular we should try a variable amount of clusters for different covering sets."

    "### Example\n",
    "An example of how the filter and clustering could work for our data, assuming that the point clouds are rotated such that the tree always grows in the $+y$ direction:\n",
    "- For the filter $f$, we use $f(x,y,z) = y$, i.e. each point is mapped to its height above the ground.\n",
    "- We then partition the resulting range (which is $[min \\ height, \\  max \\ height]$) into intervals with overlap; the values of $l$ and $p$ will have to be tuned.\n",
    "- We then cluser points into balls, (rotated) boxes, or similar shapes. The key requirement is that *clusters that belong to the same leader/support branch should overlap, while clusters that belong to different branches should not*. This requires tuning the size of the balls/boxes.\n",
    "- From these clusters and their overlap, we can construct the mapper graph.\n",
    "- In the graph, we should be able to identify the four key parts of the tree:\n",
    "    - There should be only two intervals ($\\textcolor{red}{red}$ and $\\textcolor{orange}{orange}$ in the example) which have only one connected component. The one with many clusters ($\\textcolor{orange}{orange}$) is the support, while the one with only a few clusters ($\\textcolor{red}{red}$) is the trunk.\n",
    "    - The leaders are formed by long, \"straight\" connected components spanning multiple intervals. Side branches are clusters which have a sharp angle to one of these leader \"chains\".\n",
    "    - Of course, one of the biggest challenges will be finding better heuristics for identifying parts of the tree which are robust against various types of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would produce a result that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![mapper graph](Mapper_Mockup_Real.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, note that there are no connections between points within the same covering set (color), so the result doesn't quite look like a tree; our challenge is to find a good filter, cover and clustering algorithm that *does* produce a tree-like shape, and ideally one where we can actually label the branches too."

    "The normal vectors contain information about the branch's growth direction, but the vectors themselves are noisy. Our situation is as follows: a branch is roughly a cilinder, so the normal vectors of the points along the surface will roughly point radially outward from the branch's center. Simply averaging them won't work, since then the resulting vector would be 0. Instead, we want to find a vector that is \"roughly perpendicular\" to all vectors in a region (i.e. a ball whose radius is roughly the radius of the branch).\n",

Fitting a plane like this can be done using PCA or similar methods. Since the vectors can be quite noisy, it might be a good idea to add some outlier removal/robustness to the PCA implementation."
