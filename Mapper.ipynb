    "# Mapper algorithm\n",
    "The mapper algorithm is a \"modular\" algorithm for creating a low-dimensional representation (usually a graph) of a large and/or high-dimensional (point cloud) dataset while preserving interesting topological characteristics. The results of the algorithm depend on three choices that we can make for it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A (combination of) *filter* function(s), mapping the dataset to a metric space (called the *parameter space*) based on some distance/similarity metric (e.g. height of points or angle relative to some center).\n",
    "2. An *open cover* of the parameter space, usually consisting of overlapping open intervals. The pre-images of the cover sets under the filter determine an open cover of the original point cloud.\n",
    "3. A *clustering algorithm* to divide the covering sets into clusters/\"connected components\". The graph will be constructed based on overlap of these clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default choice for the parameter space is $\\mathbb{R}$, which produces a graph as a result. However, Mapper can also be extended to $S^1$ (producing a graph with cycles) or $\\mathbb{R}^M$ (producing a simplicial complex of dimension $\\leq M$). For specific choices of filter and parameter space, cover, and clustering algorithm, we retrieve other well-known TDA algorithms for representing high-dimensional data, such as density clustering trees, disconnectivity graphs, and Reeb graphs; mapper is essentially a generalization of these techniques."

    "### Filters, covers & clusters\n",
    "The *filter* function essentially reduces data points to only their relevant characteristics (e.g. reducing a 3d point $(x,y,z)$ to only its height $y$). Given a set $X$ of $N$ points, the filter is a function $f: X \\to Z$ (usually the parameter space is $Z = \\mathbb{R}$, but it can also be $\\mathbb{R}^2$ or $S^1$) which assigns a value to each of the $N$ points. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then partition the *parameter space* $Z$ based on the range $I$ of $f$; this is typically done using a set $S$ of smaller, overlapping intervals, defined by a length $l$ and a percentage of overlap $p$. For example, if $I = [0,2]$, $l = 1$ and $p = 2/3$, then $S = \\{[0,1], [1/3, 4/3], [2/3, 5/3], [1, 2]\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we use this partitioning of $Z$ to derive a cover $\\mathcal{U}$ of $X$, defined by $\\mathcal{U} = \\bigcup_{I_j \\in S} f^{-1}(I_j)$. We also divide the *covering sets* $X_j = f^{-1}(I_j)$ further into clusters $X_{jk}$, which can be thought of as representing connected components. Ultimately, each cluster will be a vertex in our complex and represents the points within it. We draw an edge between clusters $X_{jk}$ and $X_{lm}$ if their intersection is non-empty, i.e. if there is a point which exists in both clusters (see also Figure 1 in the mapper paper). Note that a clustering algorithm usually assigns each point within an $X_j$ to *one* unique cluster; this means there will be no edges between clusters within the same covering set $X_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how do we divide these $X_j$ into clusters? That's using a user-defined *clustering algorithm*. Mapper does not place any requirements on this, so any (domain-specific) algorithm will work. This appears to be the part of the algorithm that Mapper is most sensitive to, so it's a good idea to test a couple different clustering algorithms, and in particular we should try a variable amount of clusters for different covering sets."

    "### Example\n",
    "An example of how the filter and clustering could work for our data, assuming that the point clouds are rotated such that the tree always grows in the $+y$ direction:\n",
    "- For the filter $f$, we use $f(x,y,z) = y$, i.e. each point is mapped to its height above the ground.\n",
    "- We then partition the resulting range (which is $[min \\ height, \\  max \\ height]$) into intervals with overlap; the values of $l$ and $p$ will have to be tuned.\n",
    "- We then cluser points into balls, (rotated) boxes, or similar shapes. The key requirement is that *clusters that belong to the same leader/support branch should overlap, while clusters that belong to different branches should not*. This requires tuning the size of the balls/boxes.\n",
    "- From these clusters and their overlap, we can construct the mapper graph.\n",
    "- In the graph, we should be able to identify the four key parts of the tree:\n",
    "    - There should be only two intervals ($\\textcolor{red}{red}$ and $\\textcolor{orange}{orange}$ in the example) which have only one connected component. The one with many clusters ($\\textcolor{orange}{orange}$) is the support, while the one with only a few clusters ($\\textcolor{red}{red}$) is the trunk.\n",
    "    - The leaders are formed by long, \"straight\" connected components spanning multiple intervals. Side branches are clusters which have a sharp angle to one of these leader \"chains\".\n",
    "    - Of course, one of the biggest challenges will be finding better heuristics for identifying parts of the tree which are robust against various types of noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This would produce a result that looks something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![mapper graph](Mapper_Mockup_Real.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, note that there are no connections between points within the same covering set (color), so the result doesn't quite look like a tree; our challenge is to find a good filter, cover and clustering algorithm that *does* produce a tree-like shape, and ideally one where we can actually label the branches too."
